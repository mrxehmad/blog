But what’s <em>really</em> going on inside them? I recently got curious about my Tenda AC9 router and decided to crack open its firmware—<code>US_AC9V1.0BR_V15.03.05.15_multi_TDE01.bin</code>—to see what secrets it holds. Spoiler: it’s a mix of the expected, the quirky, and the slightly unsettling. Here’s what I found, how I got there, and why it might matter.</p><h2 id=\"step-1-cracking-the-shell-with-binwalk\">Step 1: Cracking the Shell with Binwalk</h2>\n<p>First things first—I needed to unpack the firmware. It’s a 7.4MB file, a u-boot uImage for a Linux/ARM kernel, timestamped October 29, 2020. Sounded like a job for <code>binwalk</code>, a go-to tool for firmware analysis. After installing it (<code>sudo apt install binwalk</code>), I ran a quick scan:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">wget https://github.com/mrxehmad/Tenda-AC9-Firmware-Analysis/raw/refs/heads/main/US_AC9V1.0BR_V15.03.05.15_multi_TDE01.zip\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">binwalk US_AC9V1.0BR_V15.03.05.15_multi_TDE01.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output revealed a TRX header, an LZMA-compressed kernel, and a SquashFS filesystem. To get inside, I extracted it:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">binwalk -e US_AC9V1.0BR_V15.03.05.15_multi_TDE01.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>This gave me a folder with a compressed kernel (<code>5C.LZMA</code>) and a filesystem (<code>18EB48.squashfs</code>). One more command to decompress the filesystem:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">unsquashfs -f -d squashfs-root 18EB48.squashfs\n</code></pre>\n<p>And voilà—a treasure trove of files in <code>squashfs-root/</code>. Time to explore.</p><h2 id=\"step-2-open-ports-and-a-network-surprise\">Step 2: Open Ports and a Network Surprise</h2>\n<p>Before diving into the files, I scanned my router (<code>10.1.15.1</code>) with Nmap to see what it’s exposing:</p><pre><code>PORT      STATE SERVICE\n80/tcp    open  http\n5500/tcp  open  hotline\n8180/tcp  open  unknown\n9000/tcp  open  cslistener\n10004/tcp open  emcrmirccd\n</code></pre>\n<p>Port 80? Expected for the web interface. 8180? Probably a secondary UI (more on that later). But 5500, 9000, and 10004? Those raised eyebrows. “Hotline” and “emcrmirccd” didn’t scream “router,” so I knew I had some digging to do.</p><h2 id=\"step-3-the-filesystem-tells-a-story\">Step 3: The Filesystem Tells a Story</h2>\n<p>Inside <code>squashfs-root/</code>, I found a mix of binaries, libraries, and configs. Nginx was running on port 8180 (<code>/usr/bin/nginx</code>), serving a Luci interface with a FastCGI backend on 8188 (<code>/usr/bin/app_data_center</code>). Port 80 was handled by <code>httpd</code>—standard stuff. But then things got interesting.</p><h3 id=\"hardcoded-connections\">Hardcoded Connections</h3>\n<p>Grepping through the files, I spotted hardcoded IPs and domains:</p><ul>\n<li><code>cloud.tenda.com.cn</code></li>\n<li><code>182.254.148.51</code></li>\n<li><code>download.cloud.tenda.com.cn</code></li>\n<li><code>182.254.218.214</code></li>\n<li><code>182.254.136.200</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These popped up in files like <code>./bin/auto_discover</code>, which sends your MAC address and timestamp to <code>api.cloud.tenda.com.cn/route/mac/v1</code>. Device tracking, perhaps? Meanwhile, <code>httpd</code> fetches ad URLs from <code>api.cloud.tenda.com.cn/route/adverts/v1</code>, defaulting to <code>www.tenda.com.cn</code> if it fails. An old-school User-Agent (<code>MSIE 5.01</code>) hinted this code hasn’t been touched in years.</p><h3 id=\"quirky-binaries\">Quirky Binaries</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>./bin/speedtest</code>: Pings domains like <code>www.taobao.com</code> and <code>www.google.com</code>—likely a bandwidth test.</li>\n<li><code>./bin/88ip</code>: Sends XML to <code>link.dipserver.com</code> for dynamic DNS.</li>\n<li><code>./bin/logserver</code>: Tries (and often fails) to ship logs somewhere external.</li>\n<li><code>./usr/sbin/telnetd</code>: A Telnet server! No startup script activated it, but its presence felt like a debug leftover.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"firewall-rules\">Firewall Rules</h3>\n<p>Hardcoded <code>iptables</code> commands caught my eye:</p><pre><code>iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport %d -m state --state NEW -j %s\niptables -A %s -o %s -j DROP\n</code></pre>\n<p>These seem to manage outbound traffic—maybe to those Tenda cloud servers?</p><h2 id=\"step-4-what-does-it-mean\">Step 4: What Does It Mean?</h2>\n<p>This firmware is chatty. It phones home to Tenda’s cloud, potentially sharing device info, fetching ads, and running services on non-standard ports (5500 and 10004 still elude me—debug backdoors?). The Telnet binary is dormant but tempting for anyone with root access. And those hardcoded IPs? A security researcher’s red flag—perfect for spoofing or tracking.</p><h2 id=\"why-it-matters\">Why It Matters</h2>\n<p>Routers like the Tenda AC9 are everywhere, yet we rarely peek inside. This little adventure showed me how much they’re doing behind the scenes—some useful, some questionable. I’ve dumped my findings on GitHub (link below) with extraction steps, hoping others might join the fun. Could 5500 be a mislabeled Telnet port? Is <code>libupnp.so</code> behind 9000? I’m a newbie at this, but tools like Ghidra are calling—I’ll dive deeper if you do.</p><p>What do you think? Ever analyzed your own gear?

            "content_html": "<p>A Pixel phone user recently reported a potentially concerning behavior related to Google Assistant and the microphone privacy indicator. According to the user, when activating Google Assistant using the voice command “Hey Google,” the microphone privacy indicator did not appear immediately. However, once the conversation with Google Assistant began, the indicator appeared, signaling that the microphone was in use. This raised questions about whether Google Assistant was listening before displaying the indicator.</p><h3 id=\"possible-explanations-for-this-behavior\">Possible Explanations for This Behavior</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Wake-Up Happens at a Lower System Level</strong><br>Google Assistant continuously listens for the wake phrase “Hey Google” using on-device speech recognition. This process does not trigger the microphone indicator because it operates at a system level without actively recording or sending data. The indicator only appears once Google Assistant starts processing the user’s request.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Delayed Privacy Indicator</strong><br>There might be a slight delay in the system UI updating to show the microphone indicator, especially if the phone is under load. This could explain why the indicator appears after Google Assistant starts responding rather than immediately upon activation.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Different Microphone Access Levels</strong><br>System-level apps like Google Assistant might bypass standard privacy indicator rules when passively listening for the wake word. The microphone is formally marked “in use” only when the Assistant starts processing a request.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Possible Software Bug</strong><br>If this behavior is new or inconsistent, it could be a software glitch introduced in a recent Android update. Google has previously adjusted privacy indicators, and any unexpected changes should be monitored for potential fixes in future updates.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"how-users-can-investigate-further\">How Users Can Investigate Further</h3>\n<p>If you’re experiencing this issue and want to ensure your privacy, here are a few steps to take:</p><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Check Mic Usage in Privacy Dashboard</strong><br>Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Permission Manager &gt; Microphone</strong> to see which apps have accessed the microphone and when.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Disable “Hey Google” for Testing</strong><br>Try turning off the voice activation feature (<strong>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Assistant &gt; Hey Google &amp; Voice Match</strong>) and manually activating the Assistant with the power button or gesture. If the indicator appears immediately with manual activation, it suggests a difference in how Google Assistant handles wake-word detection.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use a Third-Party Mic Monitoring App</strong><br>Apps like <strong>Access Dots</strong> or <strong>Bouncer</strong> can provide additional insights into microphone access and alert users to unexpected mic activity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"should-users-be-concerned\">Should Users Be Concerned?</h3>\n<p>While this behavior does not necessarily indicate unauthorized microphone access, it does highlight a gap in transparency regarding when the microphone is actively listening. Google states that Assistant only listens for the wake word and does not store audio until activated. However, privacy-conscious users may want to take extra precautions to verify this claim.</p><p>If you’ve noticed similar behavior on your Pixel or another Android device, sharing your experience can help determine whether this is an isolated issue or a broader software concern.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a protocol that allows users to manage and share files over the web. While connecting to a WebDAV endpoint is straightforward on many platforms, Windows users may encounter challenges, such as errors while mapping WebDAV drives or accessing files. This guide explains how to troubleshoot common WebDAV issues and successfully map a WebDAV drive in Windows.</p><hr>\n<h2 id=\"common-webdav-issues-in-windows\"><strong>Common WebDAV Issues in Windows</strong></h2>\n<p>Some common errors while attempting to map a WebDAV drive in Windows include:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>“System error 67 has occurred”</strong>: Indicates that Windows could not find the specified network resource.</li>\n<li><strong>“The network name cannot be found”</strong>: Often caused by URL formatting issues or an inactive WebClient service.</li>\n<li><strong>Login prompts with valid credentials</strong>: Indicates a mismatch between authentication requirements or unsupported protocols.</li>\n<li><strong>“The folder you entered does not appear to be valid”</strong>: Usually occurs when Windows cannot verify the WebDAV endpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-map-a-webdav-drive-in-windows\"><strong>Steps to Map a WebDAV Drive in Windows</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-test-the-webdav-url\"><strong>1. Test the WebDAV URL</strong></h3>\n<p>Before mapping a drive, ensure the WebDAV server is working correctly:</p><ol>\n<li>Open a web browser and visit your WebDAV URL (e.g., <code>https://example.com/webdav</code>).</li>\n<li>Verify that you can log in and access the files.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the URL works in the browser, proceed to the next step. If not, check your server settings or consult your server administrator.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"2-use-the-correct-unc-path-for-webdav\"><strong>2. Use the Correct UNC Path for WebDAV</strong></h3>\n<p>Windows requires a specific UNC format for WebDAV connections over HTTPS. Use the following syntax:</p><pre><code>\\\\hostname@SSL\\path\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p><ul>\n<li>If your WebDAV URL is <code>https://example.com/webdav</code>, the UNC path would be:<pre><code>\\\\example.com@SSL\\webdav\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"3-map-the-webdav-drive\"><strong>3. Map the WebDAV Drive</strong></h3>\n<p>To map a WebDAV drive in Windows:</p><ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt</strong> as Administrator.</li>\n<li>Run the following command:<pre><code class=\"language-cmd\">net use Y: \\\\example.com@SSL\\webdav /user:YourUsername YourPassword /persistent:yes\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace <code>Y:</code> with your desired drive letter.</li>\n<li>Replace <code>YourUsername</code> and <code>YourPassword</code> with your WebDAV credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If successful, you’ll see a confirmation message. The drive will now appear in File Explorer.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"4-enable-the-webclient-service\"><strong>4. Enable the WebClient Service</strong></h3>\n<p>The Windows WebDAV client relies on the WebClient service. Ensure it’s running:</p><ol>\n<li>Press <code>Win + R</code>, type <code>services.msc</code>, and press Enter.</li>\n<li>Locate <strong>WebClient</strong> in the list.</li>\n<li>If the service is stopped, right-click and select <strong>Start</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set the <strong>Startup Type</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Restart the service if necessary.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"5-configure-windows-for-basic-authentication\"><strong>5. Configure Windows for Basic Authentication</strong></h3>\n<p>Some WebDAV servers use Basic Authentication, which may need to be explicitly enabled in Windows:</p><ol>\n<li>Press <code>Win + R</code>, type <code>regedit</code>, and press Enter.</li>\n<li>Navigate to:<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WebClient\\Parameters\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Modify or create the following registry keys:<ul>\n<li><strong>BasicAuthLevel</strong>: Set this DWORD value to <code>2</code> (enables Basic Authentication over HTTPS).</li>\n<li><strong>UseBasicAuth</strong>: Set this DWORD value to <code>1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Restart the WebClient service after making these changes.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"6-save-webdav-credentials\"><strong>6. Save WebDAV Credentials</strong></h3>\n<p>To avoid repeated login prompts, save your WebDAV credentials:</p><ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Credential Manager</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add a new <strong>Windows Credential</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Network address: <code>example.com</code></li>\n<li>Username: Your WebDAV username.</li>\n<li>Password: Your WebDAV password.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"7-address-webdav-upload-limits\"><strong>7. Address WebDAV Upload Limits</strong></h3>\n<p>If your WebDAV server limits file uploads (e.g., 100 MB):</p><ol>\n<li>Adjust the upload size limit on the server. For example:<ul>\n<li><strong>Apache</strong>: Increase <code>LimitRequestBody</code> and <code>php.ini</code> file size limits.</li>\n<li><strong>Nginx</strong>: Increase <code>client_max_body_size</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>IIS</strong>: Modify the <code>maxAllowedContentLength</code> property.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use chunked uploads if supported by your WebDAV client.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"8-test-with-third-party-webdav-clients\"><strong>8. Test with Third-Party WebDAV Clients</strong></h3>\n<p>If Windows fails to connect, try a third-party WebDAV client:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Cyberduck</strong>: An open-source client for managing WebDAV connections.</li>\n<li><strong>WinSCP</strong>: A robust tool for FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV.</li>\n<li><strong>RaiDrive</strong>: Maps WebDAV as a network drive with additional configuration options.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"troubleshooting-common-errors\"><strong>Troubleshooting Common Errors</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"error-system-error-67-has-occurred\"><strong>Error: System Error 67 Has Occurred</strong></h3>\n<p>This error typically occurs due to:</p><ul>\n<li>Incorrect URL formatting: Use <code>\\\\hostname@SSL\\path</code>.</li>\n<li>The WebClient service not running: Start the service via <code>services.msc</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"error-login-prompt-fails-despite-correct-credentials\"><strong>Error: Login Prompt Fails Despite Correct Credentials</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Check server-side authentication settings.</li>\n<li>Save credentials in the Credential Manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"error-the-folder-you-entered-does-not-appear-to-be-valid\"><strong>Error: The Folder You Entered Does Not Appear to Be Valid</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the UNC format (<code>\\\\hostname@SSL\\path</code>).</li>\n<li>Ensure the WebClient service is running.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Mapping a WebDAV drive in Windows requires careful attention to URL formatting, service configuration, and authentication settings. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can successfully resolve connection issues and map your WebDAV drive. If problems persist, third-party WebDAV clients can provide additional flexibility and troubleshooting insights.</p><p>Let me know if you’d like to customize this article further!</p>",
